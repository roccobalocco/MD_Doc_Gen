# MD_Doc_Gen

MD Documentation Generator.

It generates an .md file with every function that is documented, in each directory of the current project.

## Pre-Conditions:

- Works only with python files
- The sintax for the documentation should start and end with `"""`

Example:
`def functions(par)-> returnType: <br> """ <br>Descriptions stuff <br> Args: <br> arg0(type): descriptions <br> Another Title <br> ... <br> """`
